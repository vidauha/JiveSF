				<h1>Why Volunteering? - by Cindy Fang</h1>
				<p>	Greg asked me at the last JIVE gathering, "Why do you like to 
					volunteer?" I explained to him that I have realized that life is 
					so much more meaningful to me when I focus on others and recognize 
					that there are many great causes that need our help and support.
				</p>
				<p>	Most recently, JIVE helped the children at the Hamilton Family 
					Center (HFC) go back-to-school shopping at Mervyn's! We had a good 
					time helping the kids pick out over $1,200 in new clothes and shoes! 
					Everyone was so excited and happy to have Mervyn's donate to these 
					underprivileged children. We hope to participate in more events with 
					the youth at HFC.
				</p>
				<p>	JIVE continues to host Friday night BINGO at the Marian 
					Residence for Women. The women are always excited to play BINGO 
					and win prizes that we bring for them. As we continue our 
					involvement there, the women at Marian become more comfortable 
					with us and have slowly opened up. It is truly moving to see women 
					begin to share their lives with us. We plan to continue our 
					monthly volunteering at Marian through the end of the year. 
				</p>
				<p>For those who do not have time to volunteer, they can still 
					contribute to the community through their donations at our social 
					events! This year, JIVE has raised over $6,000 for charity, 
					benefiting local and national charities and organizations, 
					including the TNDC, YMCA, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, 
					Edgewood Center for Children, and East Palo Alto Cesar Chavez 
					Middle School.
				</p>
				<p>	Thank you to those who have participated in our community 
					service events. Of course, we always welcome your ideas and 
					suggestions, and if you'd like to help organize a service event 
					with JIVE, please contact Cindy cfang329@yahoo.com. Stay tuned for 
					upcoming events - Support the fight against Breast Cancer at Race 
					for the Cure and save our environment at our Tree Planting in SF 
					neighborhoods. Next month JIVE plans to return volunteer at the SF 
					Food Bank. Last time, we sorted hundreds of pounds of oranges and 
					frozen corn! :)
