				<h1>J.I.V.E. BABY - by Joanne Liu</h1>
				<p>	Whenever I tell people about Jive, their first response is, 
					“Cool!  I’ll check out DriveSF.”  “No, no, it’s Jive,” I explain.
					Joining In Virtuous Endeavors.  Cheesy acronym?  Sure is, 
					but that’s what I love about Jive.  We get to do whatever we 
					want, from meaningful volunteer events to meaningful large-scale 
					parties!  The concept of Jive was formulated in a lazy car ride 
					along the 101 with my roommate Vida.  I was able to tap into my 
					pool of brilliant SF friends who all bring something unique to the 
					table.  They all have initiative, which was most important.  But 
					please allow me to describe each officer in a way the Officers 
					webpage cannot.
				</p>
				<p>	Vida has incredible energy and fears nothing.  She will shake 
					her finger at you like nobody’s business.  Cindy has the sincerest 
					love for serving the community.  Greggy Poo is our ever peppy 
					mascot, while Shaun is the too cool for school guy who yells, 
					“JIVE BABY!” out the window whenever we finish an event.  Reliable 
					Dave updates our website every 10 minutes and talks like an 
					announcer.  Sweet Lindsey heads up recruiting while Steve balances 
					her out by maintaining the “ratio.”  Erwin constantly dreams about 
					our funds (or our lack thereof), and Julie is always eager to dip 
					her hands into any project.  Michelle is tall, loud, and types up 
					the meanest minutes.  This group is the group who did not roll 
					their eyes when the idea of Jive was discussed at the dinner table.  
					This group is incredible.  I suppose it is only fair that I comment 
					on the final unmentioned member.  Joanne is…well…I’m hungry.
				</p>
				<p>	Founded in October ‘04, JiveSF is in the process of filing for 
					non-profit status.  Our primary purpose is to unite young 
					professionals in contributing to and serving the community.  
					.Volunteer work can be fun, and we hope to remind everyone of 
					that. 
				</p>
				<p class="noindent">Sincerest thanks,</p>
				<p class="noindent">Joanne</p>
